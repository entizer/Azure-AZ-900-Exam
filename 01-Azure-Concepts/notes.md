# Azure Concepts

## Why is cloud computing usually cheaper to use?
- No commitment
- Lower operating costs
  - Change from CapEx to OpEx
- Scale infrastructure as the demands of the business change

Pay for what you need without maintaining the hardware and overhead of a datacenter

## Why should I move to the cloud?
Scale faster
- Do not need to plan/buy capacity in advance
- Adopt agile/development practices to make changes quicker with more condfidence

More availability without the need for building redundant datacenters

## Cloud computing advantages?
- High availability - ensure services remain available to users with little downtime
- Scalability
  - Vertically - add more resources to VMs
  - Horizontally - add additional nodes to handle more load
- Elasticity - use of autoscaling (Scale Sets or containers) to increase or decrease resources as needed
- Agility - deployment of new applications can be done immediately
- Geo-distribution - provide the same level of server across the globe without creating new datacenters
- Disaster recover - ensure data and infrasture is backedup/avialable from other regions

## Cloud Service Models
**IaaS** - Hardware/facility security is maintained by the provider
**PaaS** - Hardware, virtual machines, networking, etc.  Applications just need to be deployed to the PaaS
**SaaS** - Everything is maintained by the provider, no application updates or maintaining is needed (Office 365 for example)

## Serverless computing
Similar to PaaS in the fact that you worry about the application code but not the underlying hardware

Can scale the code or process wihtout needing the manage the VMs, networking, updates or other details

## Types of clouds
- Public Cloud - Services available to anyone
- Private Cloud - Dedicated hardware for a single orgnaization or business, either 3rd part hosted or on-prem
- Hybrid Cloud - combining the two above to share data between

## Azure Marketplace
Location to find software from vendors to be deployed in Azure

Need to pay the software cost but also the VM or other resource uptime

## Azure Services
Use this as a reference:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/tour-of-azure-services

## Azure account
Does not cost anything to create an Azure Account, you pay for what is used

A "free account" can be obtained that provides credits for many services for the first 12 months
